\section{Two Examples}

It's best to learn by example!

Try running these programs!  You don't have to key in their source code;
instead, you can get it from the raw file which produced this document,
\url{http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/UnixAndC/CLanguage/Curses.tex},
and then editing out the non-code.

If you are in a hurry, you may wish to go directly to the second
example, which anyway is better commented and makes use of more {\tt
curses} features.

\subsection{Simple, Quick Introductory Example}

Our first example does very little.  You can think of it as a very
primitive, uninteresting game.  But it gives us a start.

The comments at the top of the source file tell you what the ``game''
does.  Compile and run the program, inputting various characters as you
like.  Then read the code (start with {\bf main()}, as you should in
general), with the comments doing the explaining.

\begin{samepage}
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-2},numbers=left]
// simple curses example; keeps drawing the inputted characters, in columns
// downward, shifting rightward when the last row is reached, and
// wrapping around when the rightmost column is reached

#include <curses.h>  // required

int r,c,  // current row and column (upper-left is (0,0))
    nrows,  // number of rows in window
    ncols;  // number of columns in window

void draw(char dc)

{  move(r,c);  // curses call to move cursor to row r, column c
   delch();  insch(dc);  // curses calls to replace character under cursor by
dc
   refresh();  // curses call to update screen
